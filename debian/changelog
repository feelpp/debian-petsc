petsc (2.1.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

petsc (2.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream, patch level 4.
  * Moved shlib building stuff from bmake/$(PETSC_ARCH)/rules to

petsc (2.1.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream patch level 9.
  * Removed . from end of descriptions (Lintian warning).
  * Switched from gcc-3.2 and friends to gcc, since it's now gcc-3.2; this will
    make building dependencies like illuminator easier (closes: #176237).
  * The -dev package now suggests illuminator-dev (as it should have long since
    done...).
  * Updated the Standards-Version.
  * Changed manpages' sections from 1L to 1 (oops!).

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Jan 2003 21:25:00 -0500

petsc (2.1.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Oct 2002 21:53:39 -0400

petsc (2.1.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Commented "make clean" in clean: rule (closes: #160240).
  * Removed lapack99-dev from build-depends since it doesn't exist on ARM;
    maybe this will actually work with gcc-3.0-built lapack on alpha?

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Sep 2002 00:06:01 +0000

petsc (2.1.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added directory handling for /usr/share/aclocal in case that dir isn't

petsc (2.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream patch level 6.
  * Uses gcc-3.2 and g77-3.2 for shared libg2c.
  * Okay, in this one the shared mpich libs should actually work (except
    libmpe, which breaks IA-64 and HPPA when I add $(PETSC_EXTERNAL_LIB) to the
    shlib linking command in bmake/rules).
  * Removed ${linear-algebra} and xlibs from petsc2.1.3 deps because they
    should be auto-detected by dh_shlibdeps (as should libg2c0).
  * New patch system should simplify future upgrades.
  * Put lapack99-dev as preferred lapack-dev in -dev package's dependencies.
  * Added petsc.m4 to -dev package (closes: #160042).

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Sun, 08 Sep 2002 07:16:28 +0000

petsc (2.1.3-1.woody.1) testing; urgency=low

  * Special release for Woody, built against its libs, etc.
  * Several significant updates vs. 2.1.1.30-1, previous woody version, as
    mentioned below.
  * Put lapack99-dev as preferred lapack-dev in Build-Depends because it
    actually works on Alpha, unlike all other lapack2-dev Providers -- see bug
    149834.
  * Commented shlib building in linux_alpha_dec subarch because I still can't
    make it work, one other small fix to that arch's petscconf.h.  (Note: this
    does not affect any uploaded Debian binary packages, just the option to
    build source with PETSC_ARCH=linux_alpha_dec which uses the non-free HPaq
    compilers for Alpha.)

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Jun 2002 19:09:33 -0400

petsc (2.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream major release.
  * Moved to Priority: extra because dependency mpich is there.
  * In includes, using EXTERN_C_BEGIN and _END from petsc.h instead of the
    whole #ifdef business; I think this will work better and be easier to port
    forward.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Jun 2002 13:29:40 -0400

petsc (2.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream patch level 8.
  * Removed ${PETSC_EXTERNAL_LIB_BASIC} from shlib linking, to get rid of
    non-PIC stuff in shlibs (closes: #142647).  This cuts the size of the shlib
    package in half, and some individual libs by a factor of ten!
  * Reinstated MPE on alpha and IA-64 since this wasn't the cause of the
    problem.
  * Because first thing broke auto linear-algebra shlib deps, put them in rules
    by hand.  (Incidentally, fixes a lintian problem with lapack deps...)

petsc (2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream major release.  Package name no longer includes patch level,
    to avoid repeated upload of 99.99% identical .orig.tar.gz.
  * Upstream patch level 6.
  * Removed MPE support for linux_alpha and derivatives to fix IA-64
    PIC/non-PIC mix in shlibs (workaround for #142647).
  * Added #ifdef __cplusplus extern "C" { } etc. to headers so C++ building
    works, removed note from README.Debian. (closes: #137978)
  * Other minor updates to README.Debian.
  * Changed library linking to -lblas2 -llapack2 to support /etc/alternatives
    symlinks in packages providing blas2-dev.
  * Removed -assume no2underscores from linux_alpha_dec/variables so fortran
    might *really* work on this subarch this time (though not shlibs)...
  * Removed empty file deleter for examples src.tar.gz.
  * Added package homepage link to readme.html

petsc (2.1.1.30-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream patch release(s).
  * Changed xlib6g-dev to xlibs-dev in -dev Depends (overlooked last time).
  * Changed atlas2-base-dev | blas-dev and atlas2-base-dev | lapack-dev (in
    rules) to blas2-dev and lapack2-dev in -dev Depends, and also Build-Depends
    now that they exist.
  * In bmake/linux_alpha_dec/variables, added SYMLINK, changed cc to ccc,
    disabled shared libs because they don't work), removed fortran junk from
    C_SYS_LIB, removed rpath, added PETSC_HAVE_FORTRAN_UNDERSCORE_UNDERSCORE to
    bmake/linux_alpha_dec/petscconf.h, so that "subarch" works again.
  * Added debian/packagename directory removal to clean target for -dec and
    -lam alternative support.
  * Removed potato mpich dir names from bmake/*/packages.
  * Added a note on C++ "libraries" to README.Debian.

petsc (2.1.1.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream patch release(s).
  * Changed xlib6g-dev to xlibs-dev in Build-Depends (breaking build on potato,
    though that hasn't worked for some time) (closes: #130521).
  * Removed atlas so it might get into testing
  * Added symlinks in -doc package so .h.html links work (closes: #130522).

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 19:34:55 -0500

petsc (2.1.1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream patch release(s!) (closes: #130407).
  * Fixed double semicolon in line 67 of src/sys/src/viewer/impls/draw/drawv.c.
  * Switched atlas2-base-dev and blas-dev, lapack-dev dependency order for
    ${linear-algebra-dev} where set in rules line 267 (closes: #129427).

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jan 2002 18:44:27 -0500

petsc (2.1.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream 2.1.1 package (closes: #126092)
  * Build-Depends on "atlas2-base-dev | blas-dev, atlas2-base-dev lapack-dev"
    instead of atlas2-base-dev so it will build on all architectures.
  * Changed default linear-algebra-dev substvar to "atlas2-base-dev | blas-dev,
    atlas2-base-dev | lapack-dev" so -dev will install on all arches.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Jan 2002 13:10:26 -0500

petsc (2.1.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depends on atlas2-base-dev since that works for PPC now.
  * Also added "gcc |", "g77 |" and "| lam3-dev" to Build-Depends.
  * Added petsc-c and petsc-fortran substvars so petsc2.1.0-dev depends on the
    appropriate compilers (closes: #111446).
  * Changed DH_COMPAT to 3 and removed petsc2.1.0.postinst.in since that
    postinst is auto-generated now.
  * Fixed bmake/linux_alpha_dec files so that "platform" works!

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Nov 2001 20:55:35 -0500

petsc (2.1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed unneeded stuff from Build-Depends.
  * Corrected bmake/*/base.site BLASLAPACK_LIB (closes: #105873).
  * Added man pages for petscarch and mpirun.lam (closes: #86677).
  * Removed "linear-algebra" substvar since the proper shlib dep should be
    dragged in by the using package (but left mpi because mpich and lam-runtime
    are not dragged in).
  * Removed -dev's c-shell dependency since petscarch is a dummy sh script.
  * Because lam changed mpirun_lam to mpirun.lam, I changed mpirun.lam to
    mpirun_lam.
  * Harmonized descriptions of petsc-dev and petsc-dbg (closes: #109572).
  * Removed references to the obsolete -examples package from docs/faq.html.
  * Updated standards version.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Aug 2001 20:08:57 -0400

petsc (2.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed obsolete "Local Variables:" from the bottom of this file.
  * Changed #define to typedef for Scalar in petscmath.h (closes: #97633).
  * Changed pdf link to pdf.gz because the pdf is compressed, and moved
    /usr/include/petsc/(*/)*.h.html from -dev to -doc (closes: #98729).
  * Changed -examples' Depends: -dev to Recommends:.
  * Put all examples minus their documentation into a src.tar.gz file,
    shrinking petsc2.1.0-examples' installed-size from 7835K to 455K!  Updated
    README.Debian accordingly.
  * At that size, there's really no longer a reason for separate
    petsc2.1.0-examples, so I'm merging it into -doc.
  * Changed atlas2-dev dependencies to atlas-dev, removed lapack from deps
    (except on PPC).
  * Removed libc6-dev from Build-Depends.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jul 2001 14:37:58 -0400

petsc (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release!
  * No more C++ ifdefs in headers (lots of work, will replace them with better
    C++ headers in the future).

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Apr 2001 22:12:36 -0400

petsc (2.0.29-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Versioned depends for petsc-dev and petsc-dbg.
  * Got rid of Replaces and Conflicts since they were only in unstable.
  * Made alternative petsc2.0.29-dbg packages provide petsc2.0.29-dbg.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Mar 2001 00:13:46 -0500

petsc (2.0.29-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * D'oh!  The control file had "Adam Powell" vs. "Adam C. Powell, IV".  So the
    last upload was marked as NMU, though all previous upload had this problem.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Mar 2001 08:31:14 -0500

petsc (2.0.29-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a fake manpage symlink for mpirun.lam.
  * Changed the double-colon clean target in bmake/common to
    single-colon. (Closes: #85770)
  * Removed PPC-only status of lapack-dev build-dep. (Closes: #85771)
  * Made PLogFlops macro in include/petsclog.h always give zero. (Closes:
    #85821)
  * Made timestepping work matrix-free in src/ts/impls/implicit/beuler/beuler.c
    and cn/cn.c. (Closes: #86073)
  * Added mvs to debian/rules clean target to preserve src/fortran/custom/TAGS.
  * Added link from readme.html to README.Debian.
  * Corrected MPE_LIB typo in bmake/*/base.site.
  * Made petsc2.0.29-dbg suggest petsc-dbg.
  * Hundreds of new documentation corrections, particularly in
    docs/manual/manual.html, also bmake/base_variables.defs.
  * Updated variable names at the bottom of this changelog for new dpkg-dev-el.
  * Updated -dev Depends adding "csh |" to c-shell.
  * Removed those diffs in examples makefiles which involve comparisons with
    empty files (empty files are removed because of policy), replaced with
    "if [ -s ...]",

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 00:25:10 -0500

petsc (2.0.29-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed hyphen from package names between petsc and version.
  * Made these hyphen-less packages replace and conflict with old packages
    (for the benefit of testing/unstable users, will remove before release).
  * Added petsc-dev and petsc-dbg virtual packages which depend on the latest
    version of devel and debug packages.
  * Changed /usr/lib subdirectory names from e.g. petsc-2.0.29 to
    petscdir/2.0.29 so all installed versions are within a single dir.
    (Closes: #81096)
  * Added m68k, mips, hppa and sparc "support" by making petscarch return
    linux_ppc for those arches; also ia64 returns linux_alpha, and arm and
    mipsel should work with the linux default.  Problem: ATLAS BLAS support is
    not used for any 32-bit BE arch, since it is not currently available on PPC
    (gcc bug, -funroll-all-loops is broken).
  * Using PETSC_ARCH=linux_alpha_dec adds -dec to package names, subdir names,
    alternatives symlinks, and shared library sonames; and modifies substvars
    for linear algebra dependencies.
  * Added lam MPI alternative using PETSC_MPI buildtime variable, which (if
    used) adds -lam to the same things as -dec is added to above; and modifies
    substvars for mpi and mpi-dev dependencies. (Closes: #82040)
  * Added alternatives symlink to mpirun.lam scripts to pull in the right
    options. (Closes: #82041)
  * Revised README.Debian for new package names, new lam build alternatives,
    and a note on /etc/alternatives symlinks.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Feb 2001 16:18:09 -0500

petsc (2.0.29-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made Depends: arch-specific since PPC depends on lapack(-dev), others on
    atlas(-dev).
  * Made all internal dependencies require the same source version.
  * Added another lib path to MPI_LIBS in bmake/*/base.site so it builds on
    mpich 1.2.0 as well as 1.1.2 (i.e. woody as well as potato).
  * It should now successfully build with PETSC_ARCH=linux_alpha_dec.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Nov 2000 22:10:01 -0500

petsc (2.0.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    packages.
  * Made petscarch manpage symlink via /etc/alternatives.
  * Changed `pwd` to $(CURDIR) in rules.
  * Eliminated empty files in -examples package.
  * New maintainer email address.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV <hazelsct@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Nov 2000 21:01:56 -0500

petsc (2.0.28.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed MPI_INCLUDES in bmake/*/base.site so petsc works with lam2-dev
    installed.
  * Added MPE support, since we're depending on mpich.
  * Fixed a bug which eliminated the petscarch manpage, now it's there again.
  * Greatly simplified .files for -examples and -dbg.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV (24) <hazelsct@mit.edu>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 22:58:10 -0400

petsc (2.0.28.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload (Closes: #72073)
  * Changed description in control file so first line fits in one line.
  * Added language to README.Debian to make it clearer people should file bug
    reports which I'll forward upstream.
  * Added debhelper to Build-Depends.
  * Changed /usr/share/doc/petsc-2.0.28-examples/src to examples with a symlink
    from src to get rid of lintian errors.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV (24) <hazelsct@mit.edu>  Thu, 21 Sep 2000 16:21:25 -0400

petsc (2.0.28.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a hyphen to the binary package names for consistency with e.g. the
    /usr/lib/petsc alternatives symlink.
  * Symlinked bmake/$(PETSC_ARCH)/*.h to include/ so one can use
    #include <petsc/petscdefs.h> or <petsc/petscfix.h>
  * Removed extraneous directories from debian/tmp so they don't show up in the
    -dev package.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV (24) <hazelsct@mit.edu>  Sun, 17 Sep 2000 23:50:40 -0400

petsc (2.0.28.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added linux_ppc to petscarch script and bmake directory.
  * Symlinked libO_c++ to libO and libg_c++ to libg so C++ should work.
  * Added -m parameter to dh_makeshlibs so it gets the library version right.
  * Removed bmake/$(PETSC_ARCH)/buildtest for good!
  * Added README.Debian file for the -dev package.
  * Added undocumented.7.gz symlink for petscarch fake manpage.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV (24) <hazelsct@mit.edu>  Wed,  6 Sep 2000 17:05:48 -0400

petsc (2.0.28.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made three files in debian/ auto-generate because they're architecture-
    dependent.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV (24) <hazelsct@mit.edu>  Wed, 30 Aug 2000 07:07:37 -0400

petsc (2.0.28.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Incorporated new linux_alpha and linux_alpha_dec bmake subdirs from
    upstream (not yet public).
  * Renamed binary packages to include version number.
  * Changed main petsc directory to /usr/lib/petsc-2.0.28.
  * Moved most files (includes, non-shared libs, petscarch) into that
    directory, with the exception of -doc and -examples files in /usr/share.
  * /etc/alternatives master link created to link /usr/lib/petsc to
    petsc-2.0.28, and lots of slaves for /usr/include/petsc and
    /usr/lib/libpetscX.so and same .a's.
  * Changed library version numbers from 1 to 2.0.28.
  * Explicitly depends on mpich now (not mpi) because I can't get lam to work.

 -- Adam C. Powell, IV (24) <hazelsct@mit.edu>  Tue, 29 Aug 2000 18:18:20 -0400

petsc (2.0.28.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * Currently depends on mpi, but I don't know whether lam will work, or
    whether it depends on which mpi petsc is built with.
  * Currently depends on atlas, will change to blas/lapack if anyone complains.
  * Assumes little endian for now (after all, everyone knows Linux is just
    for Intel :-), I'll have to fix that.
