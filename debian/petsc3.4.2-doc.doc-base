Abstract: PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable
 (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential
 equations. It employs the MPI standard for all message-passing communication.
 Several sample scientific applications, as well as various papers and talks,
 demonstrate the features of the PETSc libraries.
