An Unstructured Grid Example.<BR>This example demonstrates how to solve a nonlinear system in parallel<BR>
with SNES for an unstructured mesh. The mesh and partitioning information<BR>
is read in an application defined ordering,which is later transformed<BR>
into another convenient ordering (called the local ordering). The local<BR>
ordering, apart from being efficient on cpu cycles and memory, allows<BR>
the use of the SPMD model of parallel programming. After partitioning<BR>
is done, scatters are created between local (sequential)and global<BR>
(distributed) vectors. Finally, we set up the nonlinear solver context<BR>
in the usual way as a structured grid  (see<BR>
petsc/src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex5.c).<BR>
This example also illustrates the use of parallel matrix coloring.<BR>
