     This file implements a SupportGraph preconditioner in PETSc as part of PC.
     You can use this as a starting point for implementing your own
     preconditioner that is not provided with PETSc. (You might also consider
     just using PCSHELL)

     The following basic routines are required for each preconditioner.
          PCCreate_XXX()          - Creates a preconditioner context
          PCSetFromOptions_XXX()  - Sets runtime options
          PCApply_XXX()           - Applies the preconditioner
          PCDestroy_XXX()         - Destroys the preconditioner context
     where the suffix "_XXX" denotes a particular implementation, in
     this case we use _SupportGraph (e.g., PCCreate_SupportGraph, PCApply_SupportGraph).
     These routines are actually called via the common user interface
     routines PCCreate(), PCSetFromOptions(), PCApply(), and PCDestroy(),
     so the application code interface remains identical for all
     preconditioners.

     Another key routine is:
          PCSetUp_XXX()           - Prepares for the use of a preconditioner
     by setting data structures and options.   The interface routine PCSetUp()
     is not usually called directly by the user, but instead is called by
     PCApply() if necessary.

     Additional basic routines are:
          PCView_XXX()            - Prints details of runtime options that
                                    have actually been used.
     These are called by application codes via the interface routines
     PCView().

     The various types of solvers (preconditioners, Krylov subspace methods,
     nonlinear solvers, timesteppers) are all organized similarly, so the
     above description applies to these categories also.  One exception is
     that the analogues of PCApply() for these components are KSPSolve(),
     SNESSolve(), and TSSolve().

     Additional optional functionality unique to preconditioners is left and
     right symmetric preconditioner application via PCApplySymmetricLeft()
     and PCApplySymmetricRight().  The SupportGraph implementation is
     PCApplySymmetricLeftOrRight_SupportGraph().
