#
#  All the Minpack coloring routines have been converted to C with the F2C
# converter. We do not include in the distribution the original Fortran 77
# code in the interest of saving disk space.
#
#  All of the MINPACK routine names have been prefixed with MINPACK
# to prevent name-space pollution.
#
#  Original Fortran 77 version for Minpack-1
#   - August 1984. Thomas F. Coleman, Burton S. Garbow, Jorge J. More'
